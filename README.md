# 3D Boids Simulation

This project was created as the final project for the course **Generative Methods for Computer Graphics (02563)** at **DTU**.

The project explores flocking behavior using compute shaders in Godot, featuring multiple implementations:
- 2D boids simulation using both CPU and GPU compute shaders
- 3D boids simulation using both CPU and GPU compute shaders
- A simple UI for visualizing and adjusting flocking parameters such as alignment, cohesion, separation, neighbor radius, and more.
