# 3D Boids Simulation

This project was created as the final project for the course **Generative Methods for Computer Graphics (02563)** at **DTU**.  
It is a rework and extension of a 2D Godot compute shader boids project originally developed by [xxx], adapted into a 3D boids simulation.

The project explores flocking behavior using compute shaders in Godot, transitioning from 2D to 3D for a richer and more dynamic simulation.
